Este.js - The evolutionary JavaScript Framework and Dev Stack
-------------------------------------------------------

With Este.js, just run one script to automatically update deps.js, run all your Mocha unit tests, and complile CoffeeScript, Stylus, and Soy templates. Browser is automatically reloaded when needed.

Tested on and compatible for OSX, Linux, and Windows.

The bulk of the application is a well-documented, thoroughly tested JavaScript framework,
written in statically-typed CoffeeScript.  This allows you to write powerful and efficient code for mobile devices and browsers.

Consider it boilerplate for mobile first development, an offline capable MVC web application, streamlined for the developer user experience.

### Quick Start Guide

  - Install Node.js (0.8+), Java, Python (Windows needs version < 3)
  - `git clone http://github.com/Steida/este.git`
  - `cd este`
  - `node run app`
  - Point your browser to `localhost:8000`
  - Build something beautiful

### More Information

The application defines structure, feature-based namespacing, template behaviour, custom events,
and compilation, all in one compact location.

We're actively working on a mobile version for ShopMVC on this stack, which should give greater
clarity by means of example. In the meantime, take a look at the  `assets/js/*` namespace.

Node run options described in `assets/js/dev/run.coffee`.
