Este.js - more than JS framework
-------------------------------------------------------

It's my beloved development stack. Run one script, to compile Coffeescript,
Stylus, Soy templates, update deps.js, run insanely fast unit tests,
automatically just on file change. One console output, to rule them all.
Browser is automatically reloaded when needed. Tested on mac, linux, win.

It contains well documented and tested javascript framework written in
statically typed CoffeeScript. It allows you to write powerful and efficient code for mobile devices and browsers.

It's boilerplaite for mobile first MVC web application with unique features
towards better user experience.

###How to use it?

  - Install Node.js (0.8+), Java, Python (Windows needs version < 3)
  - `git clone http://github.com/Steida/este.git`
  - `cd este`
  - `node run app`
  - Open browser at `localhost:8000`
  - Build something beautiful

###Ok. I got it, what's next?

Take a look at the app. It defines structure, namespacing (by features ftw), how component uses templates, custom events, compilation into one Ã¼ber small file. This is just the beginning. TodoMVC (mobile version) is in process. In the meantime, see what `assets/js/*` namespaces contains yet.

Node run options described in `assets/js/dev/run.coffee`.

###Near future

  - TodoMVC (mobile version)
  - localization
