Este - Google Closure project boilerplate and dev stack
-------------------------------------------------------

Run one script, to compile Coffeescript, Stylus, Soy templates, update deps.js,
run insanely fast unit tests, automatically just on file change. One console
output, to rule them all. Browser is automatically reloaded if needed (live reload). Tested on mac and win.

###How to use it?
  
  - Install Node.js, Java, Python
  - Clone repository
  - Type `node run app` into console
  - Open browser at `localhost:8000`
  - Build something beautiful

###Ok. I got it, what's next?

Take a look at the app. It defines structure, namespacing (by features ftw), how component uses templates, custom events, compilation into one Ã¼ber small file. This is just the beginning. TodoMVC (mobile version) is in process. In the meantime, see what `assets/js/*` namespaces contains yet.

Node run options described in `assets/js/dev/run.coffee`.

###Near future

  - TodoMVC (mobile version)
  - localization

###Recommended editor: [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com)
