Este - Google Closure based project boilerplate

What's that?
  It's my beloved development stack. Run one script, to compile Coffeescript,
  Stylus, Soy templates, update deps.js, run insanely fast unit tests, on
  file change. One console output, to rule them all. Browser is automatically
  reloaded if needed. Tested on mac and win.

How to use it?
  Install Node.js, Java, Python.
  npm install -g coffee-script
  npm install -g mocha
  npm install -g stylus
    (todo: unglobalize, same as chai)
  Clone repository.
  Install Sublime Text
    Consider these packages:
      Package Control
      CoffeeScript
      Stylus
      SoyTemplate
      Clipboard History
      JsFormat
      Git - git commands for command palette
      SideBarGit - like Tortoise inside Sublimetext
      Jade
    Check settings and snippets
      https://github.com/Steida/Sublimetext-user-settings
  Type 'node run app' into console.
  Build something beautiful.

All commands (documented in run.coffee)
  'node run app'
  'node run app --deploy'
  'node run app --deploy --debug'
  'node run app --verbose'
  'node run app --buildonly'

Ok. I got it, what's next?
  Take a look at the app. It defines structure, namespacing (by features ftw),
  how component uses templates, custom events, compilation into one Ã¼ber small
  file. This is just the beginning. TodoMVC (mobile version) is in process.
  In the meantime, see what este.mvc namespace contains yet.

este.mvc
  Model, collection, router.., todo: examples, docs, etc.

Namespaces
  Namespaces in assets/js. App is obvious, dev are development scripts, este
  is my personal everything-i-consider-as-reusable library. You, or your
  company, should maintain your own persisted-shared-wisdom library too.

Near future
  Github project page
  Demos
  TodoMVC (mobile version)
  localization
  validations
  two-way databinding
