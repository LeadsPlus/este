Este - Google Closure based project boilerplate

What's that?
  It's my beloved development stack. Run one script, to compile Coffeescript,
  Stylus, Soy templates, update deps.js, run insanely fast unit tests,
  automatically just on file change. One console output, to rule them all.
  Browser is automatically reloaded. Tested on mac and win.

How to use it?
  Install Node.js, Java, Python.
  Clone repository.
  Type 'node run app' into console.
  Open browser at localhost:8000.
  Build something beautiful.

What editor should I use?
  Sublime Text.
  
  Must-have packages
    Package Control
    CoffeeScript
    Stylus
    SoyTemplate
  
  Recommended packages
    Clipboard History
    JsFormat
    Git - git commands for command palette
    SideBarGit - like Tortoise inside Sublimetext
    Jade
  
  My settings and snippets
    https://github.com/Steida/Sublimetext-user-settings

run script commands
  'node run app'
  'node run app --deploy'
  'node run app --deploy --debug'
  'node run app --verbose'
  'node run app --buildonly'

Ok. I got it, what's next?
  Take a look at the app. It defines structure, namespacing (by features ftw),
  how component uses templates, custom events, compilation into one Ã¼ber small
  file. This is just the beginning. TodoMVC (mobile version) is in process.
  In the meantime, see what assets/js/este namespace contains yet.

este.mvc
  Model, collection, router.., todo: examples, docs, etc.

Namespaces
  Namespaces in assets/js. App is obvious, dev are development scripts, este
  is my personal everything-i-consider-as-reusable library. You, or your
  company, should maintain your own persisted-shared-wisdom library too.

Near future
  Github project page
  Demos
  TodoMVC (mobile version)
  localization
  validations
  two-way databinding
